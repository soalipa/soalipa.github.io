Emma was known for her adventurous spirit and her love for exploring the unknown. She had heard stories of an enchanted forest at the edge of the village, a place where magical creatures roamed, and hidden treasures lay waiting to be discovered.</p><p></p><p>One bright and sunny morning, Emma decided to embark on a great adventure.

As she entered the forest, she was immediately greeted by the soothing sound of rustling leaves and the chirping of birds.</p><p></p><p>Deeper and deeper into the forest, Emma ventured. The trees grew taller, and the air felt thicker with enchantment. She stumbled upon a bubbling brook, where a group of playful fairies danced around the crystal-clear water, their wings glistening in the sunlight. Emma watched in awe, feeling like she had stepped into a magical wonderland.</p><p></p><p>As the day passed, Emma encountered many strange and wondrous creatures. She helped a lost gnome find his way home and shared a picnic with a talking squirrel who told her stories of ancient wisdom.

There, beneath a massive, ancient oak tree, she discovered a chest filled with sparkling gems and precious jewels.

And so, her story lived on, a testament to the power of discovery and the enchantment of the world around us.</p><br />

                        Contohnya :<br /><br />The Ugly Duckling<br />oleh Hans Cristian Andersen<br /><br />One upon time, a mother duck sat on her eggs. She felt tired of sitting on them. She just wished the eggs would break out.<br /><br />Several days later, she got her wish. The eggs cracked and some cute little ducklings appeared. "Peep, peep" the little ducklings cried. "Quack, quack" their mother greeted in return.<br /><br />However the largest egg had not cracked. The mother duck sat on it for several days. Finally, it cracked and a huge ugly duckling waddled out. The mother duck looked at him in surprise. He was so big and very gray. He didn't look like the others at all. He was like a turkey.<br /><br />When the mother duck brought the children to the pond for their first swimming lesson., the huge grey duckling splashed and paddled about just as nicely as the other ducklings did. "That is not a turkey chick. He is my very own son and quite handsome" the mother said proudly.<br /><br />However, the other animals didn't agree. They hissed and made fun of him day by day. Even his own sisters and brothers were very unkind. "You are very ugly" they quacked.<br /><br />The little poor duckling was very unhappy. "I wish I looked like them" he thought to himself. One day, the ugly duckling run away and hid in the bushes. The sad duckling lived alone through the cold and snow winter. Finally the spring flowers began to bloom. While he was swimming in the pond, he saw three large white swans swimming toward him. "Oh, dear. these beautiful birds will laugh and peck me too" he said to himself. But the swans did not attack him. Instead, they swam around him and stroked him with their bills. As the ugly duckling bent his neck to speak to them, he saw his reflection in the water. He could not believe his eyes. "I am not an ugly duckling but a beautiful swam" he exclaimed.<br /><br />He was very happy. From that day on, he swam and played with his new friends and was happier than he had never been.<br />

                        <strong>Queen of Arabia and Three Sheiks</strong><br />Maura, who like to be thought of as the most beautiful and powerful queen of Arabia, had many suitors. One by one she discarded them, until her list was reduced to just three sheiks. The three sheiks were all equally young and handsome. They were also rich and strong. It was very hard to decide who would be the best of them.<br />One evening, Maura disguised herself and went to the camp of the three sheiks. As they were about to have dinner, Maura asked them for something to eat. The first gave her some left over food. The second Sheik gave her some unappetizing camel’s tail. The third sheik, who was called Hakim, offered her some of the most tender and tasty meat. After dinner, the disguised queen left the sheik’s camp.<br />The following day, the queen invited the three sheiks to dinner at her palace. She ordered her servant to give each one exactly what they had given her the evening before. Hakim, who received a plate of delicious meat, refused to eat it if the other two sheiks could not share it with him.<br />This Sheik Hakim’s act finally convinced Queen Maura that he was the man for her. “Without question, Hakim is the most generous of you” she announced her choice to the sheiks. “So it is Hakim I will marry”.<br /><br />sumber : http://www.belajarbahasainggris.us/2014/01/5-contoh-singkat-narrative-text.htmlAladdin, snow white, kebo iwo .

                        <p><strong>Narrative Text</strong></p><p>In the forest the fastest running animal is the <strong>rabbit</strong>. No one can beat him. The rabbit arrogantly posed a challenge to all forest dwellers to be able to defeat him.</p><p>When none of the other animals dared to accept his challenge, suddenly the turtle, which was known to walk very slowly, said he had accepted the challenge. One forest in unison laughed at him in disbelief. Moreover, the rabbit who was so arrogant underestimated the ability of the turtle.</p><p>On the day of the start of the match the <strong>rabbit </strong>began to show his ability to run very fast at the beginning of the match. The turtle began to walk quietly and slowly, as if ignoring the ability and arrogance of the rabbit.</p><p>The <strong>rabbit </strong>because he felt that he had the upper hand after running a long distance, he walked leisurely, then sat under a tree. The very cool wind apparently lulled the rabbit to sleep.</p><p>Apparently the <strong>turtle </strong>although walking very slowly but he never stopped. Until finally he passed the rabbit who was asleep under a tree.</p><p>Finally the rabbit woke up and chased the turtle, but unfortunately his efforts were in vain, because the turtle had already reached the finish line and became the winner. The rabbit realized his arrogance.</p><p>The <strong>fable </strong>above gives a message to us that high ability if not accompanied by humility will only produce arrogance. On the other hand, ordinary abilities but accompanied by perseverance will definitely produce real results.</p><p><strong>Questions</strong></p>Who was the fastest animal in the forest?What was the rabbit’s challenge?Why did the all forest laugh at the turtle?What did the rabbit do under the tree?How did the turtle defeat the fast rabbit?What can you learn from the story?Pembahasan<p>The <strong>story </strong>above is a part of <strong>narrative text</strong>.

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

 volunteered to become the king's next meal.<br />
Ajisaka went directly to the king's palace.“I am willing to be your next
 meal. Your Highnees. However, I have a request.“ said Aji Saka to the 
king. “Whatever you please, young man, I will grant your request,“ the 
king replied. “Before you eat me, grant me some land. Just enough length
 of my own headcloth.“ continued Aji Saka. “Come, Young Man. Let's 
measure your headcloth so that I can have my meal and you can have your 
land“ agreed the king.<br />
Ajisaka began to unwrap the cloth tied around his head. The king got 
down from his throne and hold one end of the headcloth. He stepped 
backward. What he didn't know was that this headcloth was much longer. 
The king kept going backward, step by step, as the cloth kept 
unraveling. He stepped backward through the palace square, backward 
across the village, holding the end of Ajisaka's headcloth. The king 
kept stepping backward until reached the sea cliftts of the sea.<br />

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at
once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?"

<br />

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
"Because he is not Phil Collins!"

</p><p>There was a dove sitting on a branch of a tree who saw an ant falling into the river. The dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the river near the struggling ant.
