 I am so glad that today is over. So many things have gone wrong. For some reasons I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I was very tired when Mum called me this morning. I fell asleep again until Mum called me again. That snooze made me late.
 I did not have time for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
 I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in my bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.
 After Biology lesson, I did not tie my shoelace properly. I tripped over it. And fell down the stairs. I hurt my knee and had to have a bandage on it. What a terrible day! I hope that I have much better one tomorrow.

                                            ScotlandA lot of people think that Scotland is a part of England but this is untrue. Scotland is, in fact, a part of Great Britain.It is governed from London but in many ways it is a separate nation. It has its own capital city, Edinburgh, its own lawsand its own stamps. It even has its own language. Gaelic, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.There are only about five million Scots, and most of them live in the southern half of country called 'Lowlands', wherethe major cities are situated.But most holiday visitors to Scotland go to the Highlands because of the high mountains and deep volleys, cleanrivers and cold 'lochs'. The Highlands are home to many rare birds and animals, like the golden eagle and the wildcat.which are found nowhere else in Britain. It is a lonely, wild and empty land. Only two per cent of the British population livethere and the population is getting smaller all the time. There is very little work so most of the young people who are bornthere have to move south to find a job. Perhaps the Highlands of Scotland will become the last great wilderness of Europe.14. The text tells us about ....a. Scotland as a nationb. Highlanders in ScotlandC. Rare animals in Scotlandd. The population in Scotlandinc15. Why is the Highland going to be the last of the great wilderness of Europe?a. It's a favorite place in Scotland.6 Contoh Soal Ujian Nasional UN Bahasa Inggris Kelas 9 SMP/MTs - Hindayani.com​</a>

 I am so glad that today is over. So many things have gone wrong. For some reasons I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I was very tired when Mum called me this morning. I fell asleep again until Mum called me again. That snooze made me late.
 I did not have time for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
 I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in my bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.
 After Biology lesson, I did not tie my shoelace properly. I tripped over it. And fell down the stairs. I hurt my knee and had to have a bandage on it. What a terrible day! I hope that I have much better one tomorrow.

                            25. ScotlandA lot of people think that Scotland is a part of England but this is untrue. Scotland is, in fact, a part of Great Britain.It is governed from London but in many ways it is a separate nation. It has its own capital city, Edinburgh, its own lawsand its own stamps. It even has its own language. Gaelic, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.There are only about five million Scots, and most of them live in the southern half of country called 'Lowlands', wherethe major cities are situated.But most holiday visitors to Scotland go to the Highlands because of the high mountains and deep volleys, cleanrivers and cold 'lochs'. The Highlands are home to many rare birds and animals, like the golden eagle and the wildcat.which are found nowhere else in Britain. It is a lonely, wild and empty land. Only two per cent of the British population livethere and the population is getting smaller all the time. There is very little work so most of the young people who are bornthere have to move south to find a job. Perhaps the Highlands of Scotland will become the last great wilderness of Europe.14. The text tells us about ....a. Scotland as a nationb. Highlanders in ScotlandC. Rare animals in Scotlandd. The population in Scotlandinc15. Why is the Highland going to be the last of the great wilderness of Europe?a.
