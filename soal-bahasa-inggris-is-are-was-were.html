Thousands of young people are mortally ill because of incurable disease. They are all kept alive in artificial ways. They have no chance to recover completely, but most of the legal systems do not allow doctors to end their lives. However, fatally ill patients should be allowed to die for several reasons. The first reason is that medical costs are very high. The cost of a hospital room can be as much as a hundred dollars per day and even more. The costs of medicines and medical tests are also high. The family of the patient is responsible for these expenses. Consequently, they would be a terribleinancialburden for themor a long time.In conclusion, because terminallyill patientshave no chance to live normal lives, they shouldbe allowed to die with dignity. Therefore, thefamily shouldhave the right to ask to turn off the life-support machines or to stop further medical treatment. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. Who are keptlive in artificialays? b. What are the rasonshypatients are allowed to die? c. How much isrobably the cost of a hospital room for 3 (three) days? d. Who shouldmostly take care of the terminally illatient? e. Why does the text mention Karen Quinlan in Paragraph 3? f. What isthe function of life-support machine? g. Why was Karen’s breathing machine turned off? 4. Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which ishe predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which istill used in radio technology.  Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.  After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague duringthe 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. Itwas while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.  Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which wer officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. What is the main idea of the second paragraph? b. What is the main idea of the third paragraph? c. What isthe possible title for the text? Hii kaka.... Bagi yang mau jawaban fulll...

                                            Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.  The koalaC.  The wombatD.  The sugar glider2. Why can the sugar glider glide from tree to tree?A.  It can spread its four legs and skin out wideB.  It is very similar to the squirrels in IndonesiaC.

But, be careful if it is wounded with a gun or the mother bear and her cubs are shocked. Some hunters claim the brown bear can outfight a tiger. A grown brownie may be up to nine feet tall. It may weigh over 1,600 pounds. But home when the brown bear is born, it weighs less than one pound. If you grew at the same rate, you would weigh almost 10,000 pounds when you were fully grown!4.

They lived from about 230 million to about 65 million years ago. In 1842, Sir Richard Owen created the word dinosaur. It came from Greek words deinos, meaning “terrible” and sauros, meaning “lizard”. Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs? Dinosaurs became extinct because there was a large comet hitting the earth. The comet caused fire and it killed the trees. Dinosaurs could not eat because there were no trees on earth and finally they died and became extinct.7. What were the days like during the dinosaurian era?A.  LongB.  ColdC.  WarmD.  Short8.

The Right to Die A difficult problem that is facing society is euthanasia, another word for mercy killing. Thousands of young people are mortally ill because of incurable disease. They are all kept alive in artificial ways. They have no chance to recover completely, but most of the legal systems do not allow doctors to end their lives. However, fatally ill patients should be allowed to die for several reasons. The first reason is that medical costs are very high. The cost of a hospital room can be as much as a hundred dollars per day and even more. The costs of medicines and medical tests are also high. The family of the patient is responsible for these expenses. Consequently, they would be a terribleinancialburden for themor a long time.In conclusion, because terminallyill patientshave no chance to live normal lives, they shouldbe allowed to die with dignity. Therefore, thefamily shouldhave the right to ask to turn off the life-support machines or to stop further medical treatment. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. Who are keptlive in artificialays? b. What are the rasonshypatients are allowed to die? c. How much isrobably the cost of a hospital room for 3 (three) days? d. Who shouldmostly take care of the terminally illatient? e. Why does the text mention Karen Quinlan in Paragraph 3? f. What isthe function of life-support machine? g. Why was Karen’s breathing machine turned off? 4. Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which ishe predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which istill used in radio technology.  Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.  After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague duringthe 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. Itwas while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.  Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which wer officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. What is the main idea of the second paragraph? b. What is the main idea of the third paragraph? c. What isthe possible title for the text? Hii kaka.... Bagi yang mau jawaban fulll...

                            12. Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

But, be careful if it is wounded with a gun or the mother bear and her cubs are shocked. Some hunters claim the brown bear can outfight a tiger. A grown brownie may be up to nine feet tall. It may weigh over 1,600 pounds. But home when the brown bear is born, it weighs less than one pound. If you grew at the same rate, you would weigh almost 10,000 pounds when you were fully grown!4. What does the text mostly tell about?A.  Brown bearsB.  Strong huntersC.  Fighting tigersD.  Alaska people5. Which statement is NOT TRUE according to the text?A.  A brown bear eats meatB.  Brown bears can beat a tigerC.  Brownie will keep away when it sees peopleD.

They lived from about 230 million to about 65 million years ago. In 1842, Sir Richard Owen created the word dinosaur. It came from Greek words deinos, meaning “terrible” and sauros, meaning “lizard”. Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs? Dinosaurs became extinct because there was a large comet hitting the earth. The comet caused fire and it killed the trees. Dinosaurs could not eat because there were no trees on earth and finally they died and became extinct.7. What were the days like during the dinosaurian era?A.  LongB.  ColdC.  WarmD.  Short8.
